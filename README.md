# Tropical-Cyclone-Multi-Hazard-Forecasting
This repository contains the code and workflow for a deep learning framework that predicts two tropical cyclone related hazards in near real time: accumulated precipitation and peak significant wave height. The models use convolutional neural networks trained on storm centred reanalysis fields and tropical cyclone track data.
